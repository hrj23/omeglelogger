	omeglelogger@gmail.com

Requirements
	You'll need a MySQL database and Apache+PHP (PHP 5.2 or greater) with the CURL extension installed.

Installation
	Drop all the files into a directory on your web server.
	Create a new MySQL database and use the omeglelogger.sql file to create the new tables and current spammer list entries.
	Edit the config.php file and add your database settings.
	Visit the logger.php file in your web browser. Click on start conversation. You should start seeing a conversation log
	Visit the index.php file in your web browser to view all the chat logs.

Troubleshooting
	If you're getting lots of empty chats, or chats that connect but nobody says anything, you might have too many connections to Omegle open.
	Omegle only allows up to three connections per IP address to be open at once. OmegleLogger uses two of these. Therefore, you can't
	have more than two OmegleLogger's running on the same webserver at a time. Instead, run one logger and let other users view the chat logs.
	If you're running OmegleLogger on your workstation, don't use the Omegle website from your browser or you may run into the same issue.
